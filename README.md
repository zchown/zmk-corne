This is my custom keymap for my 5 column Corne keyboard. 
Using a smaller split custom keyboard makes typing feel easier and like less work for longer periods of time. The benefits of never having to move my hands are incredible with all my symbols available without effort.


This is almost exactly the miryoku layout. This could easily be achieved by just using the amazing Miryoku github page and build actions but I like having the ability to make changes easily as I please.
